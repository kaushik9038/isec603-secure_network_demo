**Author:** Kaushik Mazumder  


## Introduction

As technology advances, nearly every device in our daily lives now includes a network interface card, connecting it to the internet. This teaching aid focuses on enhancing understanding of home Wi-Fi security, wireless security protocols, vulnerability analysis, and best practices for securing a home network.

With the proliferation of internet-connected devices, the number of potential attack vectors has risen significantly. Many of these devices have limited resources, constraining the types of encryption and security protocols that can be applied. This resource sensitivity makes these devices more susceptible to attacks.

In this guide, we will cover:

- **Home Wi-Fi Basics**
- **Wireless Security Protocols**
- **Vulnerability Assessment**
- **Practical Steps for Securing Home Networks**

By the end, readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of wireless security and methods to protect their home IoT networks.
