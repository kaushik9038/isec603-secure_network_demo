Introduction 
Todayâ€™s technology has evolved to an extent where we have a network interface card on every single device, we use in our day to day lives. In this teaching aide I will focus on home Wi-Fi, wireless security protocols, vulnerability study and securing our home network. With the rise in devices connecting to the internet, the attack vectors have also increased significantly. Moreover, these devices are resource sensitive, which limits the type of encryption security policies that can be implemented on them, making these devices more vulnerable to attacks.
